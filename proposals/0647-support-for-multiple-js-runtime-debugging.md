# RFC0647: Support for multiple Java Script runtime debugging

## Summary

The current implementation of `metro-inspector-proxy` assumes the existence of only one runtime in the React Native application. In some cases, an application can have more than just one JavaScript Runtime. But debugging these additional runtimes via Chrome DevTools is not possible.

## Motivation

Some libraries, like Reanimated library, create their runtime, and with the current implementation of `metro-inspector-proxy`, debugging these runtimes isn't possible. This issue can also be encountered in brownfield apps, which might have multiple JavaScript runtimes. This limitation of the Metro server has a negative impact on the developer experience, as developers using libraries with custom runtimes can't use Chrome DevTools to inspect the code being executed. We would like to see `metro-inspector-proxy` updated to allow debugging of any JavaScript Hermes runtime that exists in React Native application.

## Detailed design

The `metro-inspector-proxy` stores information about the existing runtime in a data structure called a `page`. However, current implementation can store only one page per the application. This problem can be solved by saving information about the pages in a list. This will allow us to register more than one page per application.

When a Hermes runtime is created, and `enableDebugging` is called on it.
```cpp
facebook::hermes::inspector::chrome::enableDebugging(std::move(adapter), "Runtime Name");
```
This method tries to send information about the new page via a WebSocket to the Metor server. Previously, the `metro-inspector-proxy` accepted only React Native JavaScript runtime - identified by the runtime name provided as a string in page. By removing this limitation, we have allowed the registration of any JavaScript Hermes runtime.

@kwasow has already prepared a PR that implements this functionality: https://github.com/facebook/metro/pull/864 
The PR is waiting for review.

## Adoption strategy

The implementation of this feature doesn't require any additional steps from application or library developers and is fully backward compatible. In Reanimated, we have been using a custom patch for Metro for almost a year without encountering any issues related to thiose changes.
